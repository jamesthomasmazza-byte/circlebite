 * or suffix of a single compound word (no boundary between two word characters). Found via a real
 * AI escalation on barcode 0050000328420 (docs/journal.md 2026-09-10): "sodium caseinate" wasn't
 * recognized as milk. Every case below is confirmed against real ingredient text from a real
 * Open Food Facts product before being added as a fix, not invented.
